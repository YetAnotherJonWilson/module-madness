# module-madness

This app uses four files to create a random number between 100 and 1,000,000, and converts that number to USD format. The one.js file exports a random number generator function. Two.js exports a function that converts the random number to USD. Three.js combines the first two functions and exports two modules with the results. App.js requires three.js and logs the results.
